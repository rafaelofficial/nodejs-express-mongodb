## Define Routes
When a client sends request for an endpoint using HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), we need to determine how the server will reponse by setting up the routes.

These are our routes:

 - `/api/tutorials: GET, POST, DELETE`
 

 - `/api/tutorials/:id: GET, PUT, DELETE`


 - `/api/tutorials/published: GET`
